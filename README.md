# phyllo-taxi

(Notes before I archive this too!)

- This repo is mostly empty but has a few tools/patterns inside my notebooks that can be useful for thresholding/image analysis/geometrical morphology, etc.
- I worked on it for my first internship in an amazing Research Project!
- Still carried around few tools that helped repetitions in notebooks work and give us time to explore, but won't bother finding them!
- I will add my presentation here too (Apologies, didn't cover much math there!).
  - Most ideas presented are in textbooks, but the notebooks cover the implementation details.
  - Refer to "Unwrapping Curves from Cylinders and Cones, T.Apostol 2007".
